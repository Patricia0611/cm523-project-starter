    <p>Externalization, a core concept in Narrative Therapy, involves separating an individual's identity from their problems. Externalization helps patients perceive their issues as external entities rather than intrinsic aspects of themselves. This shift in perspective empowers individuals to tackle problems more objectively and reduces self-stigmatization. In the context of this project, allowing users to transform anxiety into a customizable object aligns closely with the practice of externalization.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="detail" id="detail2">
    <p>Visualization is a powerful tool often used in psychological and therapeutic settings. Research indicates that mental imagery can help individuals manage stress and regulate emotions. Visualization involves creating detailed mental images to represent emotions or stressors, making abstract feelings more tangible and manageable. By enabling users to assign specific shapes, colors, and sizes to their anxiety, the project leverages visualization to transform the abstract nature of anxiety into a concrete form. This approach not only aids in self-awareness but also enhances emotional processing.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="detail" id="detail3">
    <p>CBT emphasizes identifying and reframing negative thought patterns to improve emotional well-being. One of its key techniques involves cognitive restructuring, where individuals learn to view their emotions objectively. The process of visualizing anxiety as an object mirrors this technique by helping users distance themselves from their anxiety and view it as a manageable entity. Additionally, emotional regulation, a central focus in CBT, is enhanced through such visual techniques, allowing users to better navigate their emotional responses.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="detail" id="detail4">
    <p>ACT focuses on the acceptance of negative emotions rather than avoiding or suppressing them. A fundamental principle of ACT is learning to coexist with challenging emotions while pursuing meaningful life goals. By providing users with tools to "live alongside" their anxiety through visualization, this project aligns with ACT's emphasis on acceptance and mindfulness. Users are encouraged to acknowledge their anxiety, and interact with it constructively.</p>
