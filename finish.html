    <p>Anxiety, though overwhelming at times, is not inherently harmful—it is our perception of it that shapes its power over us. Through this brief journey of visualizing your anxiety, I hope you’ve found a moment to see it for what it truly is: a passing object, external to you, and separate from your essence. May this experience inspire you to approach your anxiety with a new perspective, to view it not as a foe, but as something you can observe, understand, and gradually take control of. Thank you for embarking on this meaningful exploration.</p>
